This is a code file for the codes I generated on Assinment 3.
The YOLO file contains a the changed cfg file in cfg/yolo-obj.cfg and new weights file, the data/obj.names file will be used in the detect.py. 
I also uploaded few photos in photo file. The darkent.py,util.py and detect.py are from ayooshkathuria, https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/YOLO_v3_tutorial_from_scratch.git.

The worked lane marking algorithm is the 1512A3.py file. I got the most helps from opencv examples and documentaion, and the segmentaion part is from Chuan-en Lin. To run the 1512A3.py file, just download it and put images in the smae dirctory. Then type the image name in after orignal=''.
